# Heaps

* A heap is a tree-based data structure in which all the nodes of the tree are in a specific order.


## Representation

* Max Heap: Stack but of k elements + Sorted + Topmost element is minima (base is filled with maximums)
* Min Heap: Stack but of k elements + Sorted + Topmost element is maxima (base is filled with minimums)

## Identification

Both condition must be there
* mention of k elements
* top / largest / smallest / least


## Functions that can be performed on a heap

* top() => get topmost element (max for minHeap and min for maxHeap)
* push and pop operation but performed only on topmost elements
